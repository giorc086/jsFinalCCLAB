	<p>A <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> and a <span id="foxFont">fox</span> once lived <span id="together">together</span>. The <span id="foxFont">fox</span>, who was the <span id="thin">weaker</span> of the two, had to do all the <b>hard</b> work, which made him anxious to <span class="animated infinite fadeOut">leave</span> his companion.</p>
    <p> One day, passing through a wood, the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> said, “Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I shall eat you.” The <span id="foxFont">fox</span> answered, “I know a place where there are a couple of nice young lambs; if you like, we will go and fetch one.” This pleased the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, so they went. The <span id="foxFont">fox</span> stole one, brought it to the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, and then ran away, leaving his comrade to devour it. This done, the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> was not content, but wishing for the other, went himself to fetch it; and being very awkward, the old sheep saw him, and began to cry and bleat so horribly that the farmer’s people came running to see what was the matter. Of course they found the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> there, and beat him so unmercifully, that, howling and limping, he returned to the <span id="foxFont">fox</span>. “You had already shown me how, so I went to fetch the other lamb,” said he, “but the farmer’s people discovered me, and have nearly killed me.” “Why are you such a <span id="glutton">glutton</span>?” replied the <span id="foxFont">fox</span>. </p>
    <p>The next day they went again into the fields. “Red-fox,” said the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, “get me something quickly to eat, or I shall eat you!” “Well,” replied the <span id="foxFont">fox</span>, “I know a farm, where the woman is baking pancakes this evening; let us go and fetch some.” They went accordingly, and the <span id="foxFont">fox</span>, slipping round the house, peeped and sniffed so <span id="long">long</span>, that he found out at last where the dish stood, then quietly abstracting six pancakes, he carried them to the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>. “Here is something for you to eat,” said he, and then went away. The <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> had swallowed the six pancakes in a very short space of time, and said, “I should very much like some more.” But going to help himself, he pulled the dish down from the shelf; it broke into a thousand pieces, and the noise, in addition, brought out the farmer’s wife to discover what was the matter. Upon seeing the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, she raised such an alarm, that all the people came with sticks or any weapon they could snatch. The consequence was that the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> barely escaped with his life; he was beaten so severely that he could scarcely <span class="animated infinite wobble">hobble</span> to the wood where the <span id="foxFont">fox</span> was. “Pretty mischief you have led me into,” said the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, when he saw him, “the peasants have caught, and nearly flayed me.” “Why, then, are you such a <span id="glutton">glutton</span>?” replied the <span id="foxFont">fox</span>.</p>
    <p>Upon a third occasion, being out <span id="together">together</span>, and the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> only able with difficulty to limp about, he nevertheless said again, “Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I shall eat you!” “Well,” said the <span id="foxFont">fox</span>, “I know a man who has been butchering, and has all the meat salted down in a tub in his cellar. We will go and fetch it.” “That will do,” said the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, “but I must go with you, and you can help me to get off, if anything should happen.” The <span id="foxFont">fox</span> then showed him all the by-ways, and at last they came to the cellar, where they found meat in abundance, which the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> instantly greedily attacked, saying at the same time to himself, “Here, there is no occasion to hurry.” The <span id="foxFont">fox</span> also showed no hesitation, only, while eating, he looked sharply about him, and ran occasionally to the hole by which they had entered in order to try if he was still <span id="smallFont">small</span> enough to get out by the same way he had come in. </p>
    <p>“Friend fox,” said the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, “pray tell me why you are so fidgety, and why you run about in such an odd manner.” “I am looking out, lest any one should come,” replied the cunning creature. “Come, are you not eating too much?” “I am not going away,” said the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span>, “until the tub is empty; that would be foolish!” In the meantime, the farmer, who had heard the <span id="foxFont">fox</span> running about, came into the cellar to see what was stirring, and upon the first sight of him, the <span id="foxFont">fox</span> with one <span class="animated infinite bounceOutRight">leap</span> was through the hole and on his way to the wood. But when the <span id="wolfFont">wolf</span> attempted to follow, he had so increased his <span id="size">size</span> by his greediness, that he could not succeed, and stuck in the hole, which enabled the farmer to kill him with his cudgel. The <span id="foxFont">fox</span>, however, reached the wood in safety, and rejoiced to be freed from the old <span id="glutton">glutton</span>.</p>
